Okay, TBH, I got the stuff working, but I feel a bit unsatisfied? I've been trying to work on really small projects to fully understand concepts as I relearn things. But I actually never used Node.js before so this was basically all new stuff. Even though I finished the project, I don't fully understand everything that went into it. I didn't really want to learn frameworks and libraries right now because I remembered how I did that when I first started programming and realized I didn't understand a lot of fundamentals. I kinda just relied on knowing the tools.

I decided to try to learn this stuff because I'm going to a hackathon this weekend and I really want to be able to create a web app. I haven't made one in years. I haven't been to a hackathon in over a year or two also so this is a big deal to me. So I decided to trudge on through and try to get this going and again, it worked, but meh?? I have a ways to go.

Also, I totally didn't do version control while I was working on this project. I think I was afraid of breaking stuff since I wasn't familiar with any of the Node stuff. Iono. I also hadn't used the command line in awhile. AHhh! 12/8/18
